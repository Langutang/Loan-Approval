# Loan-Approval
Will someone get approved a loan based on criteria

A deep learning model that identifies a successful applicant to receive a loan. Prints "Approve" if the loan will be approved, "Denied" if
the respondent's credentials don't satisfy the deep learning model's reach.

This is IMF data consisting of Loan_ID	Gender	Married	Dependents	Education	Self_Employed	ApplicantIncome	CoapplicantIncome	LoanAmount	Loan_Amount_Term	Credit_History	Property_Area	Loan_Status fields of a current applicant, and using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) deep learning model for predicitons.

I took this model and implemented a DjangoAPI connected to a form for users to input their own information for loan approval.
